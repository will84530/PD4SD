# Particle Designer for StudyCat Design-Team v.0.1.0

This is made for designer who is working on particle design on windows OS.

## How to use

You can move your `.json` particle files or `.png` texture files into the folder `\Resources\Assets` to be loaded and be edited on this simulator, and you can save the file you edited. The file will save in the folder `C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\PD4SD\Documents` . (explorer window will pop when it be saved.)



## Prepare

If you want to paste the `.json` files into `Assets` folder, you must bring the `.png` file together or particle setting will not find the texture.
If you want to open its source code on Solar2D simulator, please set the screen size to `1280 * 720` .

## Future

This application has just been produced, all the functions are basic, has many points need to upgrade.
